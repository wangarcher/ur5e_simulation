  <!-- The package has 2 examples of converting joystick commands to servo commands.
       This is the lower-latency C++ example. You can modify it in your own package for
       your own type of gamepad or joystick.
       It reduces latency (slightly) compared to spacenav_teleop_tools.launch.
       We don't plan to accept pull requests for other controller types using this method,
       because it would be too much to maintain.
       But, we do plan to accept teleop_tools config files (see spacenav_teleop_tools.launch)
